# Battleship

double click a ship to rotate  
click a ship to select  
click an empty cell to move a selected ship  
press ready to start the game  
click on an opponent's cell to fire at that cell  
if you hit you get to go again  
if you miss, it's the opponent's turn.  
The opponent will move immediately after you so it may be a little confusing
